Dawn 10.0.0 introduces new color schemes, animation options across templates and sections, performance improvements for large images, an improved announcement bar, and the ability to change the shape of product cards images.

### Added
- Important: Fade in animations will now be enabled by default on your theme. If you’d like to disable them, navigate to your theme settings → animations → uncheck “Reveal sections on scroll”.
- Important: We’ve introduced a new visual way of setting your theme's colors. In your theme settings, you can now configure 5+ color schemes and apply them across sections in your themes. The default colors are created based on your theme’s current color settings, but we recommend reviewing them before publishing.
- We’ve added new animations to your theme settings where you can have sections fade in or slide in when the user scrolls.
- You can pick a new hover effect for buttons and cards - 3D lift.
- You now have options to add animations on the Image with Text and Image Banner sections.
- We added options to change the shape of the product card images.
- We introduced the ability to send and schedule a gift card to a recipient.
- You can now create different color schemes and apply them across your pages and sections.

### Changed
- Important: Color schemes now apply to content on the Image Banner and Slideshow sections, regardless of container visibility. Please review and adjust color schemes to ensure the content is readable.
- There are now unique identifiers on navigation links, which lets you add custom CSS in the Header section.
- We improved the announcement bar by adding a slider for each announcement instead of stacking them on top of each other.
- We introduced new placeholder images across all theme sections.

### Fixes and improvements
- We fixed some spacing issues in the mobile drawer.
- We improved the performance of the Collage section images.
- We fixed some accessibility issues with the language and currency picker in the mobile drawer.
- We fixed the facet filter animation duration to match the menu drawer.

### Removed
- Important: Decorative icons will now always inherit text color.
